# InteractiveNMDS
A short tutorial on how to build an interactive NMDS plot using 16S rRNA amplicon abundance data and geochemistry.
## 1. Download the code and open using R [https://www.rstudio.com/]
Once opened in R, the user can run each code chunk and view the output or click 'run all code' in the upper right and review the output. 
This code contains links to raw data in the putt-ad/InteractiveNMDS repository on github.
## 2. import your own data
If the user has abundance count data and sample checmistry data, the user is free to upload the data and run the steps for their own analysis.
